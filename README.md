### drupal-as-api


This project is intended to convert the Drupal Core, and Contributed Modules on an API. This way output will be a JSON string, and the PHP templates would not be required any more. Caveats, such as authentication and Post/Delete methods are an issue.

### 'License'

This is free and unemcumbered software released into the public domain. For more information, see the accompanying UNLICENSE file.

If you're unfamiliar with public domain, that means it's perfectly fine to start with this skeleton and code away, later relicensing as you see fit.
